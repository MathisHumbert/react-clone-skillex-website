# Skillex Cloned Webiste

This project comes from Benjamin Code who launched a challenge, reproduce a part of the landing page in 1 hour. I decided to realize this challenge, it took me 2 hours to get a result that I liked. Then the other parts of the page interested me, so I decided to clone the whole page.

The original website is [Skillex](https://skillex.webflow.io/#find-passion) that I found on [Dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/17015850-Skillex-Online-Education).
